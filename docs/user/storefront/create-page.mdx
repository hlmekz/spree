Besides the automatically generated pages like the PDPs, PLPs, and policies, Spree makes it easy to add custom pages to your store, such as an About Us page or product-focused landing pages.

Using these pages can give you more ways to engage your audience and tell your brand story, helping you tailor your store's content to better connect with your customers and highlight what matters most.

To add a new page, navigate to the Pages tab of the admin dashboard found under Storefront.

Then, click on the blue “Add New Page” button in the top right corner. This will redirect you to the page creation page where you simply need to enter the name of the new page to proceed.

Note: You can also edit the SEO settings for the new page at this time, but you can also do it later after the page has been created.

After naming and clicking ‘Create’, you’ll be redirected to the Theme Editor where you can begin customizing the newly created page.
