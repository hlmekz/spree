Spree 5 ships with a new mobile-first storefront that is fully customizable & themeable.

## Architecture

New Storefront consists of:

* Themes

    Themes are a collection of styles, scripts and templates that are used to style and layout the storefront.

* Pages

    Pages are the main building blocks of the storefront. They are used to create the structure of the storefront. Each Theme comes with a set of default pages such as Home Page, Product Listing Page, Product Page, etc, but you can create your own custom landing pages as well.

* Sections

    Sections are the building blocks of the pages. They are used to create the structure of the pages. Each Section is a collection of Blocks.

* Blocks

    Blocks are the smallest building blocks of the storefront. They are used to create the content of the pages.

The new storefront comes with a Page Builder that allows you to build pages using a drag-and-drop interface, as a part of Spree Admin Dashboard (provided via `spree_admin` gem). This allows you to create new pages and sections, modify existing ones, and add new blocks to the pages in a no-code way.

You can learn more about the Page Builder in the [User Documentation](/user/storefront/theme-editor).
