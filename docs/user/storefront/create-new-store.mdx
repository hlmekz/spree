The multi-store approach also allows you to manage separate brands or product lines while keeping centralized control over operations and analytics.

To add a new store, click the site name in top left corner to reveal a dropdown menu and click “+ New Store”.

* Currency - the currency you’ll be selling in

* Import Products - whether or not you’d like to import products from another store

Note: The country, currency, product imports, and payment methods you choose for your new store will depend on your specific use case and overall business model.
