Blog posts are a powerful tool in ecommerce, helping to drive traffic to your store through SEO while building trust and credibility with your audience. They allow you to showcase expertise, share product tips, and engage customers with content that keeps them coming back.

To add a new post, navigate to the Posts sections of the admin dashboard found under Storefront.
