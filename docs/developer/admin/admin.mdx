Spree Admin Dashboard is the main interface for managing your store. It's built with Ruby on Rails and is installable as a `spree_admin` gem. If you're using Spree Starter, this is already installed for you.

## Overview

Admin Dashboard can be fully customized to your liking. You can extend the UI with custom CSS and JavaScript, and you can add new sections to the dashboard or modify existing ones.

The basis of the admin dashboard is same as with any Ruby on Rails application:

* [app/views/spree/admin/](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/main/admin/app/views/spree/admin) - Contains the views for the admin dashboard
* [app/controllers/spree/admin/](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/main/admin/app/controllers/spree/admin) - Contains the controllers for the admin dashboard
* [app/javascript/spree/admin/](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/main/admin/app/javascript/spree/admin) - Contains the Stimulus.js controllers
* [app/assets/stylesheets/spree/admin/](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/main/admin/app/assets/stylesheets/spree/admin) - Contains the SASS stylesheets
